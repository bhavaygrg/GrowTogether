## Inspiration
A walk in nature while thinking of a project!

## What it does
Nurture a virtual tree together in Discord. Grow, catch bugs, earn NFT rewards. Unite your community with blockchain-powered fun!

## How we built it
We came up with the metaphor of how nurturing the tree is analogous to nurturing a community and then slowly but surely built upon it. We primarily used GitHub and Flow for building the app. For Graphics and NFTs we used Adobe. Communication was done through discord.

## Challenges we ran into
- Bhavay struggled with Flow and the smart contracts
- Shobhit struggled with discord
- Shreya struggled with NFTs

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Shobhit is proud of how good the project turned out with 2 days of collaborative work
- Bhavay is proud of learning how to deploy smart contracts in flow
- Shreya is proud of how well the NFT's and the graphics came out
- Bhavay and Shobhit are proud of completing their first hackathon!!!!

## What we learned
- Collaboration is the key
- Be open to ideas. Ideate, Build, Iterate.
- Working with beginners is fun

## What's next for GrowTogether
- Better way to integrate wallets and authentication through Flow
- Hosting GrowTogether independently
